serverless mobile chat app
STACK: TS

FRONT:
  react native + expo
  tailwind

BACK:
  socket.io
  Redis (for fast data access)
  [another database to store for persistence] for now let's say SQLite with DrizzleORM

PLAN OF ACTION:
1. build out a super bare bones chat client in react native.
   can send and receive messages via websockets
   stored in memory with redis and displayed by react native
2. message persistence with SQLite
3. features + make it cute!
